I have tried my best and full effort to do the project to gain experience and job opportunity.

Note:
I haven't implemented reports due to time shortage. But I will update it later.

chart and dynamic image upload isn't implemented due to some problem that I can't figure it out yet. But I will be trying to solve the problem.

1. install nodejs runtime
2. install angular CLI
3. run frontend: [npm start] it will opened at port 4200
4. run backendL: [npm start] it will opened at port 3000
